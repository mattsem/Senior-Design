# 2023 Senior-Design SCU Computer Engineering Department "Best in Session"
Spotify Music Recommendation project by Matt Seminatore and Peter Hay

# What this is:
Many recommendation algorithms suffer from over-representation of popular items in the data set. In layman's terms, if some people like a song, the algorithm concludes that most people will probably like that song. This results in a feedback loop where algorithms continuously push pop songs, even if they aren't close matches to a person's tastes. Our algorithm aims to address the underrepresented "long-tail" of the dataset, that matches a users tastes, but corrects for overrepresentation due to popularity.

# How to run:
Download the repo, then follow the link to tracks.csv, download it and move it to the folder. Run server.py. Login to Spotify to select songs from your library or use the search feature to search for any song. Build a list of songs to use as seeds for the algorithm, and then hit create playlist to generate recommendations.
